 Abstract This research mainly studies which groups of people more likely to be infected in COVID-19. I use ggplot to draw two histograms include two variables which are Age Group and Source of Infection. Obviously, the result shows that the group of people with age around 20-60 years and the group of people with close contacts are much easier to get infected in COVID-19. My conclusion is that if you are the one in 20-60 years old group you need to be careful in this special COVID-19 period and everyone try to reduce close contact with others.</description>
